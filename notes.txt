Bubble sort : Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

The bubble sort function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted.
It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap. (optimized bubble sort refer it )
